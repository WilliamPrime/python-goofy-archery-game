for context
my programming skills really arent that good
ive been coding python for arround 4 years
but just at the level of functions and that sorta thing

pretty much GCSE level code
(uk high school qualification)

i had ZERO experience with using classes
so this project was not the fastest to make as i was learning how to use classes along the way

despite not being the fastest to code
or the most efficient code
or really anything remarkable
im still proud of getting something done that taught me new stuff


anyway getting onto what the code/project actually is

for an upcomming school project i wanted to make something like the project i made
but i needed to prove to my teacher that it was possible to make it
so this project began

the idea was an archery / projectile game
where the board/ screen is stored as an aray of ascii characters
and then the player can aim the projectile by setting its speed and direction

the programme then decomposes the intial velocity into its respective x and y component
and calulates the nessesary things to plot it

the programme doesnt work the best as ascci characters have an aspect ratio of x:y == 9:20 
so the line looks steeper than it should be
i could fix this fairly easily however i was trying to get a proof of concept and functioning minigame thingy working :D 

ps- the game doesnt run well in web interpreters as they dont use a constant character width
i found it works on python idle
and on vs code

if you play it i would love feedback
