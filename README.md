for context
my programming skills really arent that good
ive been coding only python for arround 4 years
but just at the level of functions and that sorta thing
pretty much GCSE level coding
(uk high school qualification)

i had ZERO experience with using classes before this project so my goal was to make something while learning to use classes

anyway getting onto what the code/project actually is

for an upcomming school project i wanted to make something like the project i made
but i needed to prove to my teacher that it was possible to make it
so this project began

the idea was an archery / projectile game
where the board/ screen is stored as an aray of ascii characters
and then the player can aim the projectile by setting its speed and direction

the programme then decomposes the intial velocity into its respective x and y component
and calulates the nessesary things to plot it

the programme doesnt work the best as ascci characters have an aspect ratio of x:y == 9:20 
so the line looks steeper than it should be
i could fix this fairly easily however i was trying to get a proof of concept and functioning minigame thingy working :D 


ps- the game doesnt run well in web interpreters as they dont use a constant character width
i found it works on python idle
and on vs code

if you play it i would love feedback
